The problem statement is to help a beauty product brand to retain customers and keep them loyal to the brand. Most customers shift their loyalties based on false information or misconceptions. To address these problems and to promote the brand, we must build a website that is brimming with features that support the business and clear any misleading remarks.

User will get to personalise features of the product, including colour, contents, quantity etc
The colour picker is a filter which has three stages of selection. First, the user chooses the general colour from the colour wheel. 
Then, the colourâ€™s hue and saturation can also be selected. Then the website will display products that match or come close to the selected colour by the user. 

User can also upload a colour to the website, either in form of a solid colour, or as an image in which the colour is present (Colour picker from image). 
The user to get exactly the recommendations of the shade that he/she wants. 
A membership programme that rewards long-time customers can also be implemented. Members will get a fixed discount every time they purchase from the brand

The methods in which the  products are manufactured will be displayed which doubles down as an awareness program against other brands and their difference in preparation methods. 

The website will host all natural products, and hopefully contribute towards reducing the carbon footprint left behind. 

AR based try-it-yourself feature will be implemented, where the user can calibrate their selfie cameras so that they can experience first-hand what they would look like using the brands product. 

The website will study current trends and automatically recommend products that go well with the already selected products in cart.

Using Frequent Pattern Analysis, we will be analysing the user interactions and study why users prefer one product over the other.
